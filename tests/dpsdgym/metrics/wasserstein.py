    """
    Calculate wasserstein randomization test results
    "We propose a metric based on
    the idea of randomization inference (Basu, 1980; Fisher, 1935). 
    Each data point is randomly assigned to one of two
    data sets and the similarity of the resulting two distributions 
    is measured with the Wasserstein distance. Repeating this
    random assignment a great number of times (e.g. 100000 times) 
    provides an empirical approximation of the distancesâ€™
    null distribution. Similar to the pMSE ratio score we then 
    calculate the ratio of the measured Wasserstein distance and
    the median of the null distribution to get a Wasserstein distance 
    ratio score that is comparable across different attributes.
    Again a Wasserstein distance ratio score of 0 would indicate that 
    two marginal distributions are identical. Larger scores
    indicate greater differences between distributions."
